title: Mapping Out Amazon's Future Home

starter:

It's a contest! Amazon has decided to make their selection process for their
HQ2 public, meaning that anyone and everyone has access to the criteria
they're looking for in their next hub. All interested cities were instructed
to submit a proposal on why that city should be Amazon's next home. Recently,
they narrowed their search down to 20 final candidate cities, and are expected
to make their final decision soon, with some experts predicting a decision
within a month or so. This interactive map will walk you through some of
Amazon's main criteria and which cities do/don't fit the bill.

closer:

Though Amazon has yet to declare the date of their announcement, analysts report
that Amazon has visited all 20 candidate cities and is expected to make an
announcement soon. We've seen all the criteria, and we know which cities match
and which ones don't. Will Amazon do the number crunching and make their
decision strictly based on data? Or are there other factors that we have yet to
know about? Only time will tell.

title: Overall Job Growth
alignment: right
text:

Amazon, in a document full of guidance for candidate cities, states that one
of their main requirements in a city is a "stable business climate for growth".
Looking at overall job growth, we can see that a bunch of cities stand out,
including Boston, Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Raleigh and Columbus.

title: Tech Sector Job Growth
alignment: left
text:
Overall job growth can then be cross referenced with job growth within the tech
sector. This highlights Austin, Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. All of which have
overall job growth over 5% in the last 10 years, and a tech sector job growth of over 6% in
the last 5 years.

title: Commuting, Airports
text:

One of the main decision factors listed by Amazon is the potential site's
access to airports. It reads "an international airport with daily direct
flights to Seattle, New York, San Francisco/Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. is
also an important consideration." Looking through the final 20 candidate cities,
we see that all but Nashville, Columbus and Montgomery County have an airport
in close proximity that meet this criteria.

title: Commuting, Congestion
text:

We then also can look at the logistics of commuting within the city. Amazon
says that they'll need to be able to shuffle around 50,000+ employees within
the city. Looking at congestion rankings from INRIX, we see that LA, Washington
DC, Northern Virginia, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and Miami all have congestion
ranking in the 10 worst cities in North America.

title: Quality of Life
text:

When looking at quality of life, we narrow it down to two major components.
Cost of living and various amenities. These two components are relatively
proportional, with the best amenities leading to higher costs of living. That
being said, we look for cities that can strike a balance between the two.

Looking simply at Costs of Living, we see that cities like Atlanta, Miami,
Austin, Denver, Chicago and Toronto all have median rent prices below $1150 per
month. An interesting note, however, is that even though Washington D.C. is on
the more expensive side, a much more affordable Baltimore is a short train ride
away.

Combining that with the amenities component (restaurants, things to do,
nightlife), we see that Atlanta, Austin and Miami all stand out in those
categories too.

title: Incentives
alignment: left
text:

All of the above factors aside, Amazon also says that various incentives are
also going to be crucial in the selection process.

Columbus, Newark, Chicago, LA, Atlanta, Montgomery County, Philadelphia and
Newark have all offered Amazon tax incentives of at least $1 billion.
