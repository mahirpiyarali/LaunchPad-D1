title: Where's Amazon Heading Next?

starter:

Amazon has decided to make their selection process for their HQ2 public,
meaning that anyone and everyone has access to the [criteria they're looking
for](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf)
in their next hub. Recently, they narrowed their search down to 20 final candidate cities, and are expected to make their final
decision soon, with some experts predicting a decision within a month or so.
This interactive map will walk you through some of Amazon's main criteria, and
which cities do (and don't) fit the bill.

Though Amazon has yet to declare the date of their announcement, analysts report
that Amazon has visited all 20 candidate cities and is expected to make an
announcement soon. We've seen all the criteria, and we know which cities match
and which ones don't. Will Amazon do the number crunching and make their
decision strictly based on data? Or are there other factors that we have yet to
know about? Only time will tell. Want more information? [Click here](https://reflect.github.io/amazon-hq2-proposals/) to access a database with the HQ2 proposals
from individual cities.

title: Introduction
text:

Here are all 20 cities. As you scroll down this article, various criteria from
Amazon will show up, and the map will pan and zoom to highlight the cities that
match (some of the cities may fall behind the blocks of text). At any point you
can click on any of the points on the map and all of the data for that city will
pop up. At the bottom of the page is a button that can unlock the map to allow
for you to explore, click and zoom around the page.

title: Overall Job Growth

Amazon, in a document full of guidance for candidate cities, states that one
of their main requirements in a city is a "stable business climate for
growth." Looking at overall job growth, we can see that a number of cities
stand out with more than 5% increase over the last 10 years. **Note:** a few
highlighted cities appear behind this block.

Of course, it's not just any kind of job that Amazon is looking for. Taking
tech jobs into account, we can cross reference the cities with an overall job
growth of 5% in the last 10 years with cities that have a tech sector job growth
of more than 6% in the last 5 years. Adding tech jobs to the equation reduces us
down to only four cities.

All of the above factors aside, Amazon also says that various incentives are
also going to be crucial in the selection process. These are all the cities that
have offered incentives of at least $1 billion.

title: Commuting, Airports
filter: airports
text:

One of the main decision factors listed by Amazon is the potential site's
access to airports: "an international airport with daily direct
flights to Seattle, New York, San Francisco/Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. is
also an important consideration." Looking at all of the cities, all but the three
highlighted cities meet this criteria.

title: Commuting, Congestion
filter: traffic
text:

But what about the logistics of commuting *within* the city? Amazon says that
they'll need to be able to shuffle around 50,000+ employees every day. Based
on congestion ratings, we highlight the 8 of the 20 candidate cities are in the 10
worst cities in North America.

title: Quality of Life
filter: all
text:

Amazon, in their criteria document, say that they want to "invest in a community where our employees will enjoy living, recreational opportunities, educational
opportunities, and an overall high quality of life." Let's narrow it down to
two major components: cost of living and various amenities. These two
components are relatively proportional, with the latter generally leading to
the former. That being said, we look for cities that can strike a balance
between the two.

title: Cost of Living
filter: rent
text:

Cities like Atlanta, Miami, Austin, Denver, Chicago and Toronto all have
median rent prices below $1150 per month, making them relatively cheap for the
cost of living. However, even though Washington D.C. is on the more expensive
side, the much more affordable Baltimore is a short train ride away.
