title: Mapping out Amazon's future home

starter:

Amazon has decided to make their selection process for their HQ2 public,
meaning that anyone and everyone has access to the [criteria they're looking
for](https://LINK_GOES_HERE) in their next hub. Recently, they narrowed their
search down to 20 final candidate cities, and are expected to make their final
decision soon, with some experts predicting a decision within a month or so.
This interactive map will walk you through some of Amazon's main criteria, and
which cities do (and don't) fit the bill.

closer:

Though Amazon has yet to declare the date of their announcement, analysts report
that Amazon has visited all 20 candidate cities and is expected to make an
announcement soon. We've seen all the criteria, and we know which cities match
and which ones don't. Will Amazon do the number crunching and make their
decision strictly based on data? Or are there other factors that we have yet to
know about? Only time will tell.

title: Overall Job Growth

Amazon, in a document full of guidance for candidate cities, states that one
of their main requirements in a city is a "stable business climate for
growth." Looking at overall job growth, we can see that a number of cities
stand out with more than 5% increase over the last 10 years, including Boston,
Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Raleigh and Columbus.

Of course, it's not just any kind of jobs that Amazon is looking for. Taking
tech jobs into account, Austin, Atlanta, Dallas and Denver have all had
overall job growth of more than 5% in the last 10 years, and a tech sector job
growth of more than 6% in the last 5 years.

title: Commuting, Airports
filter: airports
text:

One of the main decision factors listed by Amazon is the potential site's
access to airports: "an international airport with daily direct
flights to Seattle, New York, San Francisco/Bay Area, and Washington, D.C. is
also an important consideration." Looking through the final 20 candidate cities,
we see that all but Nashville, Columbus and Montgomery County have an airport
in close proximity.

title: Commuting, Congestion
filter: traffic
text:

But what about the logistics of commuting *within* the city? Amazon says that
they'll need to be able to shuffle around 50,000+ employees every day. Based
on congestion ratings, LA, Washington DC, Northern Virginia, New York,
Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and Miami all rank in the 10 worst cities for traffic
in North America.

title: Quality of Life
filter: rent
text:

Finally, quality of life is an important qualification for Amazon's choice.
[Do you have a link or specific quote for this? -TW] Let's narrow it down to
two major components: cost of living and various amenities. These two
components are relatively proportional, with the latter generally leading to
the former. That being said, we look for cities that can strike a balance
between the two.

Cities like Atlanta, Miami, Austin, Denver, Chicago and Toronto all have
median rent prices below $1150 per month, making them relatively cheap for the
cost of living. However, even though Washington D.C. is on the more expensive
side, the much more affordable Baltimore is a short train ride away.

Taking amenities (restaurants, things to do, nightlife) into account, we see
that Atlanta, Austin and Miami all stand out in those categories too.

All of the above factors aside, Amazon also says that various incentives are
also going to be crucial in the selection process.

Columbus, Newark, Chicago, LA, Atlanta, Montgomery County, Philadelphia and
Newark have all offered Amazon tax incentives of at least $1 billion.
